#libft
Library of helper functions used in later 42 projects.

Consists mostly of remakes of existing C functions (string.h, stdlib.h, ctype.h, etc) along with some custom ones such as `split` to split a c-string by a given delimiter or a host of `lst` functions to manipulate linked lists.

## Installation
